    "# When to use Bayesian Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian Networks are powerful tools for modeling probabilistic relationships and making inferences under uncertainty. They are particularly useful in a variety of scenarios where their unique advantages are most beneficial. Here are some situations in which Bayesian Networks are especially well-suited:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Modeling Complex Systems with Uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case**: Medical Diagnosis, Fault Diagnosis in Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why**: Bayesian Networks can effectively model the probabilistic relationships between different variables, making them ideal for domains where uncertainty is inherent. For instance, in medical diagnosis, symptoms and diseases are often probabilistically related.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Handling Missing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case**: Customer Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why**: Bayesian Networks can infer the missing values using the relationships between the observed data. This makes them suitable for datasets where missing data is a common issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Causal Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case**: Policy Making, Root Cause Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why**: Bayesian Networks allow for the representation and reasoning about causal relationships. This can be crucial in understanding the impact of different factors and making decisions based on these causal relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Sequential Decision Making\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case**: Robotics, Automated Planning\n",

    "\n",
    "### 5. Integration of Expert Knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case**: Expert Systems\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### 6. Data Fusion\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case**: Sensor Networks, Environmental Monitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why**: Bayesian Networks can combine information from multiple sources to provide a coherent probabilistic model, making them useful for data fusion tasks.\n",

    "### 7. Probabilistic Reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case**: Natural Language Processing, Recommendation Systems\n",

    "## High-Level Intuitions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Probabilistic Relationships**: Bayesian Networks represent the probabilistic relationships between variables. They help model the uncertainty and dependencies in complex systems.\n",
    "2. **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**: The network structure is a directed acyclic graph where nodes represent random variables and edges represent conditional dependencies.\n",
    "3. **Inference**: Bayesian Networks allow for efficient probabilistic inference, enabling the calculation of the likelihood of certain outcomes given observed evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Nodes**: Represent random variables (e.g., Flu, Cold, Fever).\n",

    "1. **Input**: Graph \\( G \\), CPTs, evidence \\( E \\) (observed values for some nodes).\n",
    "2. **Output**: Posterior probabilities \\( P(Q | E) \\) for query nodes \\( Q \\).\n",
