    "The structure of the network (i.e., the directed edges) represents the conditional dependencies between variables:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Inference in Bayesian Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "When performing inference in a Bayesian Network (e.g., computing the probability of a variable given some evidence), algorithms like Variable Elimination or Belief Propagation are used. These algorithms apply Bayes' rule and the chain rule of probability to update and compute the desired probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example from the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "In your example, you have the following conditional dependencies:\n",

    "- `Cough` depends on `Cold`.\n",
    "- `Body Ache` depends on `Flu`.\n",
    "\n",

    "### High-Level Intuitive Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**\n",
    "We aimed to create a synthetic dataset to model the relationship between common illnesses (Flu and Cold) and their symptoms (Fever, Cough, and Body Ache). We then used this dataset to build a Bayesian Network to perform probabilistic inference, allowing us to determine the likelihood of having the flu given specific symptoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps and Interpretations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Generation:**\n",
    "   - We generated a synthetic dataset with 1000 samples where each sample represents an individual.\n",
    "   - For each individual, we determined whether they have the flu or a cold based on predefined probabilities (10% chance for flu, 30% chance for cold).\n",
    "   - Based on whether an individual has the flu or a cold, we generated their symptoms (Fever, Cough, Body Ache) using probabilities that reflect how likely these symptoms are given the diseases.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Data Head:**\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "    Flu  Cold  Fever  Cough  BodyAche\n",
    "    0    0     0      0      0\n",
    "    0    0     0      0      0\n",
    "    0    0     1      0      1\n",
    "    0    0     0      0      0\n",
    "    1    0     1      0      0\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Building the Bayesian Network:**\n",
    "   - We constructed a Bayesian Network to model the dependencies between diseases and symptoms.\n",
    "   - The network structure was defined such that:\n",
    "     - Flu affects Fever and Body Ache.\n",
    "     - Cold affects Fever and Cough.\n",
    "   - Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs) were defined for each variable to quantify these dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Performing Inference:**\n",
    "   - We used the Variable Elimination algorithm to perform inference on the Bayesian Network.\n",
    "   - Given the evidence that an individual has a fever (Fever=1) and a cough (Cough=1), we wanted to determine the probability of them having the flu.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Evidence Provided:**\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Fever    1\n",
    "   Cough    1\n",
    "   dtype: int64\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Inference Result:**\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   P(Flu=0)    0.701195\n",
    "   P(Flu=1)    0.298805\n",
    "   dtype: float64\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuitive Interpretation of Results\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Evidence Provided:** We observed that the individual has both a fever and a cough.\n",
    "- **Inference Result:**\n",
    "  - The probability of the individual not having the flu (P(Flu=0)) is approximately 70.12%.\n",
    "  - The probability of the individual having the flu (P(Flu=1)) is approximately 29.88%.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "Despite the presence of symptoms commonly associated with the flu (fever and cough), the model indicates that it is more likely (70.12%) that the individual does not have the flu. This result likely stems from the higher baseline probability of colds and their strong association with the given symptoms. The cold is a more common cause of these symptoms in our dataset, hence the higher probability of not having the flu.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "By using a Bayesian Network, we can integrate multiple pieces of evidence and quantify the likelihood of various hypotheses (in this case, having the flu) given the evidence. This approach helps in making informed decisions based on probabilistic reasoning, even when dealing with uncertain or incomplete information."

    "## Explanation of Variable Elimination\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variable Elimination** is a fundamental algorithm used for performing inference in Bayesian Networks. The goal of variable elimination is to compute the probability distribution of a subset of variables (query variables) given some observed evidence while efficiently handling the summation over the other variables (hidden or irrelevant variables). Here's a high-level explanation of how variable elimination works:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bayesian Network:**\n",
    "   - A graphical model that represents the probabilistic relationships among a set of variables.\n",
    "   - Consists of nodes (variables) and directed edges (dependencies between variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inference:**\n",
    "   - The process of computing the probability distribution of certain variables given evidence about other variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Factors:**\n",
    "   - Represent the joint probability distributions of subsets of variables.\n",
    "   - In the context of Bayesian Networks, factors are derived from Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps of Variable Elimination\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "   - Identify the query variables $ \\mathbf{Q} $ (variables of interest).\n",
    "   - Identify the evidence variables $ \\mathbf{E} $ (variables with known values).\n",
    "   - Identify the hidden variables $ \\mathbf{H} $ (all other variables that are not in $ \\mathbf{Q} $ or $ \\mathbf{E} $).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Factors Representation:**\n",
    "   - Convert the Bayesian Network's CPTs into factors.\n",
    "   - Incorporate the evidence into the factors by setting the evidence variables to their observed values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Eliminate Hidden Variables:**\n",
    "   - Select a hidden variable $ H $ and eliminate it by summing out $ H $ from the joint distribution.\n",
    "   - This involves multiplying all factors that include $ H $ and then summing over $ H $.\n",
    "   - Repeat this process for all hidden variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Combine Remaining Factors:**\n",
    "   - After all hidden variables are eliminated, combine the remaining factors that include the query variables.\n",
    "   - Multiply these factors together to obtain the joint distribution over the query variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Normalization:**\n",
    "   - Normalize the resulting joint distribution to ensure it is a valid probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Variable Elimination\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a simple Bayesian Network with three variables: $ A $, $ B $, and $ C $, with the following dependencies:\n",
    "- $ A \\rightarrow B $\n",
    "- $ A \\rightarrow C $\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to perform inference to find $ P(A | B = b, C = c) $.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "   - Query variable: $ A $\n",
    "   - Evidence variables: $ B, C $\n",
    "   - Hidden variables: None in this case, as we are only interested in $ A $.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Factors Representation:**\n",
    "   - $ P(A) $ from the CPT of $ A $.\n",
    "   - $ P(B | A) $ from the CPT of $ B $ given $ A $.\n",
    "   - $ P(C | A) $ from the CPT of $ C $ given $ A $.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Incorporate Evidence:**\n",
    "   - Set $ B = b $ and $ C = c $ in the factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Combine Factors:**\n",
    "   - Multiply the factors $ P(A) $, $ P(B = b | A) $, and $ P(C = c | A) $ to obtain the joint distribution over $ A $.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Normalization:**\n",
    "   - Normalize the resulting distribution to obtain $ P(A | B = b, C = c) $.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variable Elimination** is an efficient method for performing inference in Bayesian Networks. It systematically eliminates hidden variables by summing them out, combines remaining factors, and normalizes the result to provide the probability distribution of the query variables given the evidence. This approach allows for accurate probabilistic reasoning even in complex networks with many variables."
